            <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Agriculture, the life-blood of civilization, is a science in turmoil.  Centuries of bad practices has led to nutrient depletion, air pollution, water contamination, toxic produce,  social unrest, and possibly global warming.  Industrial practices such as monocroping, machine harvesting, chemical fumigation, genetic modification, deforestation, and globalization have been blamed for a good portion of these problems.</p>
        <p>Academia has spent over a century developing an economicly viable farming system that addresses most of the problems that we face today.  So far, methods of crop diversifying, nonchemical pest and weed control, organic fertilizers, and companion planting have been utilized in the organic farming industry. None have been adopted by the section of farms that control the majority of food sales and thus pricing.  
        <p>Until the majority of consumers decide that quality, local produce that is safely grown is worth paying more for, the agriculutre industry has little incentive to change.  In the meantime, if you want healthy, locally grown produce without breaking the bank, there are several options for growing it at home.</p>

    <section id="raisedBed">
        <header>Raised Beds</header>
        <p>Unless you are lucky enough to live on good land out in the country, odds are your soil is contaminated with toxic metals, chemical runoff, or hard to kill nematodes.  Rasied bed gardens are an urbanites answer to crummy soil.  They can be erected out of salvaged materials, they keep your plants seperate from soil contamination, and they are almost impossible to flood.</p>
        <p>The soil you choose to fill your beds with will make a <em>huge</em> difference in the health of your plants.  Heavy soil will have poor water penetration and will give alot of plants a hard time rooting.  My favorite mix is a combination of perlite, peat moss, wood mulch, and compost.  The perlite and wood mulch will both add space inside the soil and give absorb nutrients, only to slowly release them into the soil.  The peat moss and mulch will absorb water, and compost is just good stuff. </p>
        <p>To ensure a decent harvest, it is important to water and fertilize frequently.  Raised beds both drain quickly <em>and</em> they are more susceptible to heat!</p>

    <section id="containerGarden">
        <header>Container Garden</header>
        <p>If you live in an area prone to flooding or you aren't allowed to build raised beds, your best bet is going to be to grow everything in containers.</p>
        <aside id="determinate">Many plants have varieties selectively grown to naturally dwarf themselves so they will grow well in containers.  Often called determinate, these plants require little in the way of pruning.</aside>
        <p>Containers are very versatile.  Let's say your tomatoes grow bushier than you expected.  In a raised bed, these tomatoes would have to be pruned back from each other.  Not so in container gardening, its a simple matter of moving your containers.  Neighbors tree bloom late and overshadow your plants?  Simply move the containers!  </p>
        <p>Containers also drain faster than raised beds.  This means multiple daily waterings if you live in an exceptionally hot area, and they go through soil pretty fast, so make sure you have some to spare.</p>
        <p>Another downside to containers is that they require more materials per square foot than a raised bed, as they need to be sturdy to take the constant moving and repositioning.</p>

    <section id="hydropnics">
        <header>Hydroponic Gardening</header>
        <p>Hydroponics removes the soil from the equation, instead delivering nutrients directly to the roots using water.  Plants are supported using containers, rafts, sand, pebbles, or root nets.  This allows for total control over the nutrient intake of your plants, with little water or nutrients wasted in the process.</p>
        <p>Gardeners and urban farmers often rely on hydroponics for its efficiency and neatness, although its abundant harvest should be reason enough.</p>
        <p>It is also very pricey to initialize.  Sterile lining, air pumps, water pumps, pipe, couplings, pressure valves, water treatment chemicals, water test kits.  These are just the tip of the iceberg.  Some gardeners add sensor arrays, artificial lighting, co2 pumps, the gadgets go on and on.</p>
        <p>The biggest draw back for hydroponics is it's <u>frailty</u> .  The reason so many add a remote monitoring system is due to how quickly a garden can fail.  Water can quickly accumulate too much nutrient and start growing algae.  If your air pump goes out, bad bacteria could set up in your roots.  Water pump goes out, the whole system becomes stagnant.  And heaven forbide you spring a leak!  All of these inevitabilities and more could wreck a hydroponics system <em>overnight</em></p>

    <section id="aquaponics">
        <header>Aquaponic Gardening</header>
        <p>It may seem a like a redundant phrase, but <u>Aquaponics </u>is actually a practical fix to alot of problems facing  hydroponics.  Aquaponics utilizes two styles of farming, Aquaculture and hydroponics.</p>
        <p>Aquaculture focuses on farming fish.  In a aquaponic system, these fish produce nitrogen.  This nitrogen is used to fertilize the hydroponics section of the garden.  In turn, the plants clean excess nutrients out of the water, making it safer for the fish.</p>
        <p>This lends more stability to the hydroponics system, removing a large problem of constantly needing to add nutrients to the water supply.  It also provides an additional revenue stream in the form of fish.</p>
        <p>Aquaponics does have the additional worry of needing to feed the fish.  Fish also like to breed, and they can quickly overwhelm your system if you aren't careful.  Fish also like to get sick, and the normal route of antibiotics could potentially concentrate in the plants at dangerous levels, so a sick brood may have to be isolated during treatment.  Similarly, fish are sensative to chemical fertilizers, so more subtle methods of nutrition may have to be used.</p>

    <section id="integratedMTA">
        <header>Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaponics</header>
        <p>To combat the problems facing aquaponics , a system called Integrated Multi Trophic  Aquaponics can be used.  Relatively new, this style of farming uses multiple species of animals, fungus, and plants to create a closed system, meaning it requires little to no input and has little to no output.  </p>
        <p>IMTA specifically chooses species to perform specific tasks in different trophic levels, setting up a complete food chain.  These species range from bivalves, crawfish, finfish, algae, phytoplankton, plants, and bacteria.  The fish or shrimp create waste in the form of uneaten food, digestive waste, and dead carcass.  The uneaten food and carcass will get eaten by a detritivores like worms or crabs, who put out their own wastes.  The digestive waste is used by algae and bacteria and converted into more accessible forms of nutrition.  In turn, the plants use as much of the nutrients as they can.  Leaving the hydroponics chamber, the water gets filtered through a bed of bivalves like clams or oysters, which are highly efficient at removing excess minerals and particles that made it through the rest of the system.</p>
        <p>The biggest downfall of IMTA is its complexity.  Each species requires alot of research before it can be incorporated into the system.  Even with every precaution taken it is still possible for the whole system to fall apart in an afternoon.</p>
        <p>The glory of IMTA is that once it is established, it can quickly produce many kinds of sellable products, with very little needed from the gardener other than to harvest its fruits and keep an eye out for disease.</p>

        <p>So, if a person is dedicated to spending some free time working with their hands and a little bit of cash, they can grow a bounty in their backyard, front porch, window sill, or even spare bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>If a person is willing to spend alot of cash, and a hefty amount of elbow grease, they can have a state of the art ecosystem that provides three kinds of meat and a stunning array of fruits and vegetables.</p>
